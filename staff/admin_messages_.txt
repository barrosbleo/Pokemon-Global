HONOR POINTS!!!!

You can honor people for reasons:

You must have 300 battles or more to honor someone.

History for honor.










battle any random pokemon (on maps only)

once you defeat that pokemon you have a 1/3 chance of finding a silver coin and a 1/7 chance of finding a gold coin.

once you add that then we can create a coin shop which supports silver and gold coins :D
